A fictitious name or trade name is a business name that is different from your personal name, the names of your partners, or the officially registered name of your LLC or corporation. 

If you decide to use a fictitious name, you must choose a name that no one else in Los Angeles County is using. Use the LA County Fictitious Business Name (FBN) Search to check if the name you want is available. Registering your name with LA County protects it from being used by anybody else.

Consider searching the internet and checking the US Patent and Trademark Office or the California Secretary of State's Corporate Division to see if your name is being used in other areas as well. You can also check whether the website address or URL for your business name is available.",,

wizard_screen_3.3.1,3.3.1,,,,3.3.1,,"The legal structure of your business affects how much you pay in taxes and your level of legal responsibility for debts incurred by your business. Here are a few of the most common types of business structures:  

A sole proprietorship is the simplest and most common structure to start a business. Sole proprietorships are owned and run by one individual, or a married couple, with no distinction between the business and the owner. The owner is entitled to all profits and is responsible for all of the business's debts, losses and liabilities.

A partnership is a single business where two or more people share ownership. Each partner contributes to all aspects of the business, including money, property, labor or skill. In return, each partner shares in the profits and losses of the business.

A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid type of legal structure that provides the limited liability features of a corporation and the tax efficiencies and operational flexibility of a partnership. LLC members report profits and losses on their personal federal tax returns, just like the owners of a partnership would.

A corporation is more complex and generally suggested for larger, established companies with several employees. ",,
